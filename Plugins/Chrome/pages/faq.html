What those mean we'll explain here:<br/><br/>				<span class="label">Unlisted:</span><br/>				Unlisted is the status of every website that doesn't have a review.<br/><br/>				<span class="label">Disputed:</span><br/>				When a bad review is added to a website and is not yet checked by anyone from the staff then the owner can dispute the review. In that case the bad review won't be shown untill someone looked at it.<br/><br/>				<span class="label">Requested</span><br/>				This is the status when someone requested that a website be reviewed but this has not yet happened. You can help by reviewing the website or waiting till the staff reviews the website.<br/><br/>				<span class="label">Verified good/bad</span><br/>				When someone from the staff has looked at the reviews and the evidence provided by the reviewer and the website then a verdict will be made and the status will become either "verified good" or "verified bad".<br/><br/>				<span class="label">Community good/bad</span><br/>				When a lot of people review a website and say it's good or bad and a staff has not yet looked at it then the status "community good" or "community bad" will be shown.<br/><br/>				<span class="label">Bad customer support</span><br/>				This status is used when a website or business provides bad, rude or unhelpful customer support. To see what the support did wrong you can click on the status and check out the reviews.<br/><br/><br/>				<span class="label">Remember, you can click on the status to get more information.</span>			</div>		</div>		<div id="status" class="questioncontainer">			<div class="question">What should I do if my website or company is reviewed and got a negative rating?</div>			<div class="answer">				You can dispute the reviews. This can be done by clicking on your websites rating and then filing a dispute. Provide as much proof as possible so that it's easier to reach a verdict.<br/>			</div>		</div>		<script src="scripts/faq.js"></script>	</body></html>
